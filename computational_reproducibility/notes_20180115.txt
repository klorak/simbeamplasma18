The lecture took less than 45 minutes.
The class feedback slides worked well.
One student said she would reference Victoria Stodden's work in her thesis.

I should have warned the students during the lecture that they would need GitHub accounts for the computer lab after lunch. One student had a lot of trouble with GitHub and was stressed out.
